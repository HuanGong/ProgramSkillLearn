# skill boost

currently, i will focus on ios app developing based on swift, and nodejs + frontend learning
  1. swift :  reading the official swift programing language pdf
  2. ios App: using jikexueyuan's video and https://www.raywenderlich.com's epic-length Tutorial
  3. html/css/js using the neteasy's video moc course

But: !!! this will change /ah
in the fact, I work on c/c++ and dev based on platform chromium;/wx
